I grew up in Palo Alto and completed my BA in Statistics at UC Berkeley. Now I'm a PhD student in Management Science and Engineering (MS&E). I'm in the [Operations Research](https://or.stanford.edu/) track and part of [Systems Utilization Research for Stanford Medicine](https://surf.stanford.edu/).
